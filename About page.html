    <p>
        My name is Daniel Amimi. Who just recently finished with his secondary education and now currently awaiting
    </p>
    <p>
        admission into the higher institution to further his stuides. I live in the city of Calabar, Cross River State
    </p>
    <p>
        but I am well conversant with other cities. This is my portfolio, though not very professional but at least
    </p>
    <p>
        formal enough, where I will like to enlighten you more about myself.

        Here are just some little information about myself. Things I have archieved, mostly schooling activities since I
    </p>
    <p>
        haven't encountered any working experience yet. Also the things I do like and those I do not like as well.

                Leadership Role
            </h5>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            I in my way, have served my leadership position the way I could in the various schools I attended. Starting
            from my primary school, Sancta Maria International Nursery and Primary School, Where I served most of the
            classes I got into as different prefects ranging from;
            <ul>
                <li>Class prefect</li>
                <li>Assitant class prefect</li>
                <li>Sanictary prefect, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            Then served the whole school by accepting the role of the School Assitant Prefect.
            <br />
            My secondary school level was not as fancy as that of my primary school. As here I didn't get much
            leadership
            roles except from the fact that I was class prefect in some classes, there was nothing much than that.

        <dd>
            Generally, I do like Sports. So I have participated in various sporting activities, in school and other
            different organization. Thsi sporting activites ranges from;
            <ul>
                <li>Football</li>
                <li>Basketball</li>

            Most of the sporting taams/clubs I got into have gone for states competition and brought back trophies and
            awards. The recent medal I got was with my football team where we took first place in the 2019/2020 schools
            inter-house sports.

                Major Interest
            </h5>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            My major interest is in computers. Computer science, programming, computer tech, computer engineering,
            coding, etc, just anything involving computers. Besides, the world is evolving so being computer is highly
            needful.
            <p>
                Amongst all the computer related courses, I decided to go into programming because of its high need in
                the world. So I decided to take some online courses under programming and I ventured into coursea, an
                online platform which helps people learn any programming language of their choice and I started with.
                After a while, I realised it was too advanced, that I needed to learn the lower languages first. So I
                started using Grasshopper, a google mobile app which teaches javascript from its bases. During that too,
                I learnt that if I wanted to be a full time programmer, I had start from the very beginning, so I
                abandoned that too. And now I am currently learning html under an institution known as
                <a href="https://tnxcollege.com/">TNX college</a>.
